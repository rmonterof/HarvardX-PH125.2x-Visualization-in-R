RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Our next principle is order by a meaningful value.
When one of the axes is used to show categories, as done bar plots,
the default ggplot behavior is to order the categories alphabetically
when they are defined by character strings.
If they are defined by factors, they are ordered by the factor levels.
But remember, factor levels default to ordering by alphabetical order.
We rarely want to use alphabetical order.
It's arbitrary.
Instead, we should order by a meaningful quantity.
In all the cases discussed, the bar plots
were ordered by the values being displayed.
The exception was the graph showing bar plots comparing browsers.
In this case, we kept the order the same across the bar plots
to ease the comparison.
Instead, we ordered by the average value of 2000 and 2015.
We previously learned how to use the reorder function, which
helps achieve this goal.
To appreciate how the right order can help convey a message,
suppose we want to create a plot to compare the murder rates across states.
We're particularly interested in the most dangerous and the safest states.
Note the difference when we order alphabetically, the default,
versus when we order by the actual rate.
The information we want is much easier to extract from the plot on the right.
Note that the reorder function lets us reorder groups as well.
In an earlier video, we saw an example related to income distribution
across regions.
Here are those two plots again.
In the first one, we simply order alphabetically.
In the second one, we order by the median value of each group.
So, we've seen a few examples of how ordering by meaningful values
make much better graphs.
