RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In every single instance
in which we have examined the relationship between two variables,
total murders versus population size, life expectancy versus fertility rates,
and child mortality versus income, we have used scatterplots.
This is the plot we generally recommend.
One exception where another type of plot may be more informative
is when you are comparing variables of the same type
but at different time points and for a relatively small number of comparison.
For example, comparing life expectancy between 2010 and 2015.
In this case, we might consider a slope chart.
There's no geometry for slope charts in ggplot2,
but we can construct one using geom_line.
We need to do some tinkering to add labels and some other changes.
The code looks something like this.
This piece of code produces the following slope chart.
An advantage of the slope chart is that it
permits us to quickly get an idea of changes
based on the slope of the lines.
Note, that we're using angle as a visual cue,
but we also have position to determine the exact values.
Comparing the improvement is a bit harder when we use the scatterplot.
Note that in the scatterplot, we have followed
the principle use common axes since we are comparing values before and after.
Now, note that when we have many points, the slope charge
stops being useful because it becomes too cluttered, and in this case,
we would use a scatterplot.
Finally, we're going to describe the Bland-Altman plot.
Since what we're interested in is in differences,
it makes sense to dedicate one of our axes to differences.
The Bland-Altman plot, also known as the Tukey Mean Different plot, and also
the MA plot, shows the difference versus the average.
Here's an example.
Here we quickly see which countries have improved the most
as it's represented in the y-axis.
We also get an idea of the overall value from the x-axis.
