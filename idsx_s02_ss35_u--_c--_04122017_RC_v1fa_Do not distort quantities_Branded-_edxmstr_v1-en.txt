RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Our next principle is do not distort quantities.
Here's an example.
During President Barack Obama's 2011 State Of The Union address,
the following chart was used to compare the US GDP
to the GDP of four competing nations.
Note that judging by the area of the circles,
the US appears to have an economy over 5 times larger than China,
and over 30 times larger than France.
However, when looking at the actual numbers,
one sees that this is not the case.
The actual ratios are 2.6, and 5.8 times bigger than China and France
respectively.
The reason for this distortion is that the radius, rather than the area,
was made to be proportional to the quantity, which
implies that the proportions between the areas is squared.
So 2.6 turns into 6.5, and 5.8, turns into 34.1.
Here's a comparison of the circles we get
if we make the values proportional to the radius, that's on the left, and so
the area, that's on the right.
Not surprisingly, ggplot defaults to using area rather than the radius.
Of course, in this case, we really should not be using area at all,
since we can use position and length.
Here's the bar plot comparing the GDPs.
