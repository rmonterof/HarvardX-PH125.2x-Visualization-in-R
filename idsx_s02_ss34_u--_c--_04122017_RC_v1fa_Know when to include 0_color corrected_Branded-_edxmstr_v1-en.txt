RAFAEL IRIZARRY: When using bar plots, it is dishonest
not to start the bars at 0.
This is because by using a bar plot, we are
implying the length is proportional to the quantities being displayed.
By avoiding 0, relatively small differences
can be made to look much bigger than they actually are.
This approach is often used by politicians or media organizations
trying to exaggerate the difference.
Here is an illustrative example.
This is a bar plot made by Fox News showing southwest border
apprehensions in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
Look how much bigger the 2013 bar looks compared to the 2011.
From this plot, it appears that apprehensions have almost
tripled, when in fact, if you look at the numbers.
They have only increased by about 16%.
Starting the graph at 0 illustrates this clearly.
This is what it looks like if the plot includes 0.
Here's another example, again from Fox News it's showing us
what would happen if Bush tax cuts expires for the top tax
rate it's comparing January 1, 2013, to the time in which this was broadcast.
We look at the bar plots, it looks like the January 1, 2013
is about 5 times bigger than the now bar plot.
Here's what it looks like with the appropriate plot, a much different
story.
When using position rather than length, then it's not necessary to include 0.
This is particularly the case when we want
to compare differences between groups relative to the variability seen
within the groups.
Here's an illustrative example showing country average life expectancies,
stratified into continents, in 2012.
In the plot on the left, which includes 0, the space between 0 and 43
adds no information, and makes it harder to appreciate
the between and within variability.
For this reason, on the plot on the right,
we restrict the range to only include the points.
